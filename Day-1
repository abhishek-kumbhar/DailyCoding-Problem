This problem was recently asked by Google.
Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the
list add up to k.
For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.

#include <stdio.h>

void main () {
    int arr[10] = {10, 15, 3, 7}, k = 17;
    for (int i = 0 ; i < 4; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < 4; j++) {
            if (arr[i] + arr[j] == k) {
                printf("True !!!\n");
                break;
            } else {
                continue;
            }
        }
    }
}
